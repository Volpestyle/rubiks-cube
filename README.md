# Rubiks Cube State Management

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Typescript & Tailwind CSS app to manage the state of a Rubik's cube in a 2D representation.

## Basics

In this flattened Rubik's cube representation, each square is labeled with either U (up), L (left), F (front), R (right), B (back), or D (Down), as well as the coordinates relative to the face it's on. This helpful during debugging to keep track of how each square is being rotated.
